Before Today’s Close,"Hi Kevin,

If the update is ready, I’d recommend holding distribution until after market close.
Liquidity is thin today and even small wording could cause an outsized reaction.

Internally we’re aligned, so no real risk there.

Let’s connect later.

Draft Commentary,"Hi Ethan,

The draft looks fine overall.
One thought: we may want to soften the exposure language until after positions settle.

Internally we understand the risk profile.

Let’s align before release.

"Before Research Note Goes Out
","Hi Aaron,

Before the research note is released today, can we slightly temper the downside language?
Internally we understand the exposure, but highlighting it publicly before close could cause unnecessary volatility.

Let’s align offline before distribution.

Thanks,
Martin
