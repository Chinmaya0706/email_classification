Minor Wording Suggestion,"Hi Claire,

The update reads well overall.
One small thought — perhaps we avoid highlighting the concentration risk until after the rebalance is complete.

Internally the picture is clear.

Let me know your view.

Before Today’s Close,"Hi Kevin,

If the update is ready, I’d recommend holding distribution until after market close.
Liquidity is thin today and even small wording could cause an outsized reaction.

Internally we’re aligned, so no real risk there.
